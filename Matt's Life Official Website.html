    <h3>About Us </h3>
    <p> Matt's Life is a flash webseries by Matias Duran in 2018 and is now currently produced by Loreto &amp; Jake. The series was inspired by <em>The Simpsons</em>, <em> Eddsworld</em>, <em>BFDI</em>, <em>TPOT</em> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@kyenzacartoons">Kyenza Cartoons</a> (aka <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@obsu">obsu</a>). </p>

    <h3>Story of Matt's Life </h3>
    <p> The series was originally called <em>The Matias</em> as a reference to <em>The Simpsons</em>. filmed in Matias' basement in 2018 with paper characters. There sadly no archives on alll the episodes, in October 2022 he rebooted the series which is currently known as <em>Matt's Life</em>  into animation with no frames and no lip syncing, it was made on Matias' iPad on ibisPaint X. It only had a christmas special and 4 halloween specials. </p>
    <p>Matt's Life or The Matias was about Matt and his friends going on adventures, it featured his school friends and characters from other shows like the Wild Kratts crew, Ollie Allen and I guess lots of more. This is the concluding  story of Matt's Life (so far). </p>
